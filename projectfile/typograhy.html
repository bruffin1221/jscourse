                          Another key change: Players with a technically positive test can also return to the facility depending on how low their viral load is — 
                          which is measured by a “cycle threshold” or “CT” value. If a player's CT value is 35 or higher, they could register as COVID positive 
                          but not be considered infectious. With that in mind, the league and union agreed on a threshold that will allow players to return to 
                          the team with CT values of 35 or higher on tests.

                1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was 
                over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 3And God said, “Let there 
                be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
                5God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the 
                first day. 6And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7So God made the 
                vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8God called the vault “sky.” 
                And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. 9And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered 
                to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters 
                he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
                </p>

                <p>
                11Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed 
                in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 12The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according 
                to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13And there 
                was evening, and there was morning—the third day.14And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate 
                the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15and let them be lights 
                in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16God made two great lights—the greater light to govern 
                the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17God set them in the vault of the sky to give 
                light on the earth, 18to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
                19And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.20And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and
                let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living 
                thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its 
                kind. And God saw that it was good. 22God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the 
                seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.24And God said, 
                “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and 
                the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock 
                according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
                26Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds 
                in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” 27So God created 
                mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

                sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” 29Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing 
                plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30And to all the beasts 
                of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in 
                it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.31God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there
                was morning—the sixth day. 1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 2By the seventh day God had finished the 
                work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it 
                he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
