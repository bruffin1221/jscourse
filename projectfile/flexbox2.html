              <div id="passion">

                 <p>Purpose</p>

                 <p>Passionate work starts with defining the people we want to serve. It should be
                    very narrow and specific. For instance, some of us may want to mothers. Well,
                    the have lots of mothers, so begin narrowing them down. You could look at working
                    mothers, stay-at moms, or mothers in your hometown.</p>
                    
                  <p>As you pick a group, construct an avatar or profile of the person. A good example, 
                     it maybe stay-at home. You can give her a name like Margaret the Mom or Susie the 
                     stay-at home. Then think about her daily routine, marriages, relationships, lifestyle. 
                     If you have any questions, speak with other stay-at-home mom and learn about them. Add this
                     information to your profile.</p>

                  <p>Once you develop a clear profile, spend time thinking about their needs. It could be opportunities
                     for networking, finding clothes for them or their child. Maybe, you into their marriages or other 
                     relationships. It could be parental advice or helping them manage their time. </p>

                 
              </div>

              <div id="service">

                <p>Service</p>
                
                <p>Now, you must decide how you can best serve this population of people. The process starts by inventoring your skills,
                   interest, knowledge, and passions. It could be anything, such as sewing, cooking, fitness, reading books, writing, or sports.
                   As you inventory, these skills think about how you can use them. In the case of the single mom, you may enjoy fitness. It could
                   be fitness classes, personal training, or becoming a physical therapist for mothers and their children. Maybe you enjoy cooking, 
                   you could prepare meals for stay-at-home moms, start a cooking class, or even run a food blog geared to stay-at-home mothers.</p>

                <p>Once you develop a good list, pick the skills that will have the greatest impact or positively effects their life . You want to 
                   think of impact in terms of depth and number. For instance, you may choose health. You could become a OBGYN or a nurse, which looks at 
                   women's overall health and fitness. On the other hand, a personal can impact more women through online a website that delivers information
                   on nutrition, lifestyle, and other area. The idea of impact helps you bring more value to people and earn more money.</p>

                <p>Finally, you want to develop these skills and interest, so you can bring greater value and impact to people. In some cases, it may not be a formal 
                   education or expensive. You can learn through tutorials, practice, and research. Other cases, you may want a formal education or take a class. For 
                   instance a doctor or nurse needs years of eduction, while a personal trainers needs a certification.

             <div id="hustle">

                <p>Hustle</p>

                <p>It is now time to roll-up your sleeves and put in the work. Taking classes and improving your skills. Begin networking with
                   like-minded people and start serving. You can start small through reading a books or online research. Volunteering or taking 
                   some courses are another good way. Maybe, you want to be a personal trainer for stay-at-home moms. You can seek a personal 
                   training certification and take some courses geared toward women's health and nutrition. Also, you can network with mothers in
                   your area or personal trainers. 
                </p>

                <p> As you develop your skills and gaining trust with people, begin earning money from your newfound skills. A personal trainer may take a job at 
                    a local gym and contact the mothers in gym. You could start a class at local park or even begin in-home training for mothers. At the beginning phase, 
                    you will exepriment and learn how to best serve them. Be aware of what is working and not working. Apply the knowledge and make changes. In some inances, 
                    you may not enjoy working at the gym. You can always change jobs or find another place to train. Maybe, you see your online busines growing, so changing 
                    or pivoting to content production. 
                </p>

                <p>Once you find what works best for you, focus on it and begin scaling. Taking this example one step further, you may learn more about online marketing,
                   web development, or SEO. These skills help you build-up your clientele, and maybe, continues growing and design a coaching program for stay at home or hire 
                   other trainers. In this way, you make a greater impact and increase your value. They added value brings more money into your pockets and a greater 
                   satisfaction to your work.
