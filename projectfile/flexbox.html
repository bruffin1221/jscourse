            <h2>Passionate Work</h2>

              <p>Passionate work takes the focus from ourselves and places on the other person. We approach our job like a musician creating their greatest musical piece or a
                sculptor making their greatest piece.</p>

                <p>Purpose</p>
                <p> Inspiration for our work start with the question "who do we serve?" This simple questions shifts the from us to other people. In other words, 
                  we no longer worry about bills or "competing with Jonses." Now, work gives a broader appeal and deeper meaning. We begin by thinking about groups of people
                  or individuals. It could also be a particular place or a think. For instance. some people may want to help youth or children. Others may target pets or pet owners.
                  Maybe, your interest may lie in a particular neighborhood or city. The idea is being focused and narrow as possible. 
                </p>

            <div id="service">

                <p>Service</p>
                <p> Now, we defined our clear purpose. We must define "how to serve." We start by taking inventory of our skills and anilities. It could be a passion for
                  fitness, cooking, computer programming, or sports. We can share those abilities with other people. Maybe, our passion for fitness could be a personal 
                  training that serves youth or a physical therapist for women. Some of us may enjoy working with our hands. You could build homes for families orr an auto mechanic
                  for working families. Maybe, you enjoy writing. You can start a lifestyle blog for mothers or share articles about your neighborhood. As you take inventory your 
                  knowledge, and skills, begin developing them. It could be a formal education or education. We can also learn informally through informal means, such as 
                  Youtube or LinkedIn. </p>

                <p>Hustle</p>
                <p>Finally, we must roll-up our sleeves and hustle. Start small by participating in Facebook groups, networking with like-minded people, or provide the service for free.
                  This stage focuses on brand building and further defining your purpose. As you get more comfortable., you can start charging and making money. Growth and scaling happens
                  as you develop your sklls and gain brand recognition.
