          <p>Purpose</p>
          <p>Who Do You Serve?</p>

          <p>Passionate work starts with the people or places that we want serve. It should be very specific group 
            and we should be clear on their needs. For instance, we could serve a city or town. Narrow it down to a specific
            part of town or you may want to work kids. Look at certain age, sex, or school. Once you decide, identify their needs
            It could be health, fitness, or money.</p>

          <p>Service</p>
          <p>How Do You Serve?</p>

          <p>Once you clearly define your clientele and their needs, you must develop your services. Be very focused 
            in the type of services and how you will deliver them. For instance, your interest could be health for elementary
            school kids. You could be personal trainer, nutritionist, or even a pediatrician. Your decision depends on your talents,
            interest, and skills. In the above example, you may enjoy school and the human body, so a pediatrician make sense. Maybe,
            you enjoy fitness and exercise. Thus, a personal trainer could be away to go.</p>

            <p>Hustle</p>
            <p>Now You Begin Serving</p>

            <p>It is time to serve. You should stop small, such as volunteering, networking, or interning. As you serve and hustle, 
              be open to new ideas and ways of serving. A good example, you may want start personal school-age kids. A bigger need
              may exist nutrition, so you may study nutrition as part of your business. Another example is you may want work in your
              neighborhood. A big need could local clothing store based on your interest. Once you open the store, you may notice 
              an opportunity for shoes and other accessories.

          <p>Proper Eating and Diet</p>

          <p>Nutrition is how we eat and prepare our food. It fuels our lifestyles and factors into our overall health. Improving
          our nutrition, starts with understanding of the nutrients and how to obtain them. These substances, which include, 
          protiens, carbodyhydrates, and fats, serve as building blocks and fuel for the body. If we choose the right foods, we 
          obtain greater levels of energy and better overall growth.

          <p>Training</p>
          <p>Proper Movement and Exercise</p>

           <p>Training focuses on exercise and movement to enhance our lives and well-being. Exercise is physical activity used for a specific
             health benefit or goal, and it can include specific workouts, the daily run, or hitting the trainer in the evening. Movement includes
             any non-exercise physical activity. It maybe walking to work or standing in line. Any movement reduces stress, improves concentration,
             and builds cardio-vascular health. Active living integrates movement and exercise into an engaging training program. It could be exercisingduring the week
             and hiking on the weekend with light weightlifting. Either way, you integrate exercise and movement into your life.
