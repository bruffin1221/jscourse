                <p>Purpose</p>
                <p> Define the group of people and places that you wish to serve. For instance, you want to serve your city. 
                    Get specific about the neighborhood, types of people, and households. You may live in a small city and may want to 
                    help young singles. Well, do some research on this group and understand their wants and needs. After you finish your research, 
                    contruct a profile or avatar of them.</p>

              </div>
                
              <div id="service">

                <p>Service</p>
                <p> Once you hsve a clear picture or profile, inventory your skills and abilities. It could be computers, cooking, financial management, or 
                  or working with your hands. Take those skills and think how they can serve this particular group of people. For instance, you may have strong tech
                  skills. It could be website that provides information on networking events. You may enjoy cooking. It could be cooking classes or helping with events 
                  that helps singles connect. Maybe, you enjoy finances. You could provide financial for young sinlges. After you inventory your skills figure-out how you 
                  can develop your skills. Some of us may need a formal educations, while others of us just need practice.

                <p>Hustle</p>
                <p>As you develop your skills and interest, start serving your desired people and places. Start small through volunteering or contributing to a 
                  community. It helps you further identify people's wants and needs, and more importanlty, you can better serve them. As you learn, changes or pivots
                  could be required. For instance, you maybe a personal trainer for mothers but may see a better as a nutritionist or health coach. In this case. seek 
                  training in these areas to better serve them. Finally, seek compensation as you serve. People value your skills and the help you provide them.
